And the manager is not willing to learn from other people or even tries to take correction concerning another thing, she believes  that only her word, must stand. And the manager talks to her subordinates anyhow not minding how you feel, or what the mean words could do to your job for that day."

My manager is a sadist if there's a word worst than that that's what she is.
Very manipulating.
Always wanting things to be done in favour of her not minding how the people working under her will feel.
She hate seeing your fellow workers Happ she will find way to make us sad.
Imposeing things by force on us.
Especially I myself there's nothing I can do to make her happy she must complain she just hate me just few months I resumed work she always find wrongs on us.
There's no day I don't return back from work I don't shed tears to extent I wanted to quit the job I nearly complain what she is doing to my mum.
She always does things that will favour this particular things in our office.
Favouritism playing in a work environment which she not be done.
She stop buying  common pure water reason she wants to reduce cost just pure water, if by God's grace she bought water she will share it till when Jesus touches her heart to do so again that's unfair and is pure wickedness.
Alot is happening in our office is it the one she will share topics to us to teach(we will type it then submit for documented and is compulsory  if you don't do so you are not respecting her).
If not that most people have come in contact with the CEO alot of us in agip will think that's what the CEO asked her to do.
She neglect people.
Please tell my manager that she should allow me to enjoy my stay here in agip ,she should stop making work so difficult for me is just for some months I will leave and continue my studies. 
Despite that am here to gain Knowledge of my Field but my SANITY matters alot.
Am just encouraged by some of the people surrounded by me in the office sometimes they will tell me to overlook  my manager that am not here to stay forever.

She favors some people and those she doesn‚Äôt like she finds fault in everything they do. She practically stopped raising money for water in the office with the support that the company is trying to reduce cost. She has her good side though but her bad side overweight her good side.
She uses hurting words on people that makes them always cry in the office.  I just wish she can change but she is too mature to change the attitude is now part of her. Sometimes I see her as a sadist always not happy seeing others happy. I wish she can learn to love herself first and have in mind that you respect others for you to be respected."

She takes some persons to be special,while the rest are just there...

She is just so rude to every staff...

I am sure, if all will say their minds 100%, everyone will talk how horrible she has been to all the staff... 

I have never seen a Manager who feels insecure each time she sees her staff discussing...

If anyone smile, she gets upset...

She derive joy in seeing people Sad...

Miss Hope needs to adjust in her life style..., She doesn't take or wish to take correction because she believes she is too perfect...."

She berates her subordinates and care less about there mental health, which is always my fight with her.  
I understand every individual should be mentally stable to blossom in all activities, be it personal socio, educational or even work environment. 
She assumes she is very much perfect and almost everyone imperfect to her; especially, those that are not in her clique, 
thereby causing strive amongst coworkers. 
She needs to be guided on managerial skills, duties, and as well nurture some good personality trait. 
She is simply manipulative. "
