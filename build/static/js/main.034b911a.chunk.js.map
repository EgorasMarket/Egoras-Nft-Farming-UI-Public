         It is estimated that over two billion people around the globe\n                are unbanked and without any access to financial services to\n                meet their daily needs. Egoras protocol (“the protocol” or “the\n                project”) attempts to be part of the solution to this problem by\n                expanding financial access and inclusion to unserved or\n                underserved communities. The protocol achieves its mission by\n                on-chain governance and a stable-value asset. The protocol\n                serves as a source of capital for the unserved or underserved\n                communities. In addition, the project seeks to improve the\n                quality of financial services as well as lower the cost of the\n                services in these communities around the globe. This whitepaper,\n                therefore, explores how Egoras protocol can solve real-life\n                problems such as helping people start businesses, supporting\n                small and medium-sized enterprises access funds for expansion;\n                and enabling families to attend to the needs while maintaining\n                good collateralization on-chain.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n            {/* ==================== */}\n            {/* ==================== */}\n            {/* ==================== */}\n            <div className=\"section whitepaper-layer2\" id=\"white_layer_2\">\n              <h1 className=\"layer-header\" id=\"intro\">\n                Introduction\n              </h1>\n\n              <p className=\"layer-paragraph2\">\n                It was thought that the advent of microfinance in the 1970s and\n                1980s would eradicate or drastically reduce the pervading\n                poverty at the time. However, four decades into the pioneering\n                work of Mohammad Yunus in Bangladesh and the establishment of\n                the Grameen Bank in 1983, the goals of microfinance have not\n                been met. Without a doubt, there are several barriers to the\n                financial success of the microfinance organization when compared\n                to other financial organizations or mainstream banks. The first\n                is the higher interest rate. It is generally acknowledged that\n                most microfinance institutions charge a very high rate of\n                interest when compared to commercial banks. This is usually at\n                the detriment of the borrowers with attendant consequences such\n                as depression and even suicide. Secondly, there appears to be an\n                overdependence of microfinance organizations on the prevailing\n                banking System. This is because most microfinance institutions\n                operate as Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), and they are\n                reliant on financial institutions such as commercial banks for\n                stabilized funding to carry out their own lending activities.\n                This overdependence of microfinance institutions on banks makes\n                them incompetent as lending partners. Finally, there is the\n                problem of over-indebtedness. Notably, the microfinance sector\n                gives loans without collateral, and this increases the risk of\n                bad debts.\n                <br />\n                <br />\n                Egoras microfinance protocol seeks to address the challenges\n                identified above. Addressing the challenges would mean that\n                loans should be given at zero interest and collaterals should be\n                required to get the loans. This also means a microfinance\n                institution, not dependent on mainstream banks.\n                <br />\n                <br />\n                To solve the high-interest rate problem, Egoras protocol\n                introduces on-chain governance where the collateral is validated\n                by the people. In this regard, no central body or company will\n                determine the collateral to be accepted and loans will be\n                processed at a zero-interest rate. In other words, the borrowers\n                do not pay interest.\n                <br />\n                <br />\n                To address the dependence issue, the Egoras protocol uses a\n                stable-value asset system to make sure that Egoras protocol does\n                not lack the funds or liquidity for the loans and these\n                stable-value assets are governed by the people.\n                <br />\n                <br />\n                Finally, the Egoras protocol introduces collateral lending to\n                address over-indebtedness in the microfinance sector. In this\n                regard, small businesses’ assets will be converted to\n                non-fungible tokens, and they represent the collateral. These\n                assets will be sold off when the borrower defaults in repaying\n                the loan\n              </p>\n            </div>\n            {/* ==================== */}\n            {/* ==================== */}\n            {/* ==================== */}\n\n            <div className=\"section whitepaper-layer3\" id=\"white_layer_3\">\n              <h1 className=\"layer-header\">\n                Decentralized Autonomous Organization\n              </h1>\n              For any microfinance institution to achieve its purpose, the\n              interest rate should be zero percent subject to payment of\n              inventory and processing fees. Notably, one of the main causes of\n              high interest rates charged by microfinance institutions is the\n              centralized governance model where arbitrary and outrageous\n              interests are fixed by the individuals in charge. Decentralization\n              of governance is therefore a solution to the high interest rates.\n              Egoras protocol adopts a Decentralized Autonomous Organization\n              (DAO) system where there is no central leadership; and decisions\n              are made by members of the system through group votes during a\n              specified period. In this way, users can vote to increase or\n              reduce the applicable inventory fees and they are also\n              incentivized as they participate in the process. As a\n              decentralized autonomous organization, no company fixes outrageous\n              interest or declines loan requests. The users vote the inventory\n              fees of their choice and also vote in the approval and declining\n              of loans. Whereas the current microfinance space is managed by\n              NGOs, microfinance banks, or individuals and regulated by the\n              government, the whole process on Egoras protocol is governed by\n              the people. No third party makes the decisions, and all data are\n              secured on Egoras smart contract which is built on Binance Smart\n              Chains. Egoras protocol is not owned by any foundation nor any\n              firm. It is a decentralized organization governed by the people.\n            </div>\n            {/* ==================== */}\n            {/* ==================== */}\n            {/* ==================== */}\n            <div className=\"section whitepaper-layer4\" id=\"white_layer_4\">\n              <h1 className=\"layer-header\">Lending Partner Governance</h1>\n              Most microfinance institutions depend on financial institutions\n              such as commercial banks for stabilized funding. This massive\n              dependence of microfinance institutions on banks makes them\n              unreliable in achieving the goals of microfinance as originally\n              conceived. The Egoras protocol does not rely or depend on\n              commercial banks. Rather, on Egoras, Microfinance banks, NGOs or\n              any lending firms or companies (collectively “lending partners”)\n              can validate borrowers or small business owners and work with\n              Egoras to distribute the loans to small businesses or any borrower\n              that wants to borrow funds from Egoras. These lending partners are\n              curated by users and community get to decide which lending partner\n              can get access to the Egoras treasury system. When an individual\n              requires a loan, the individual will contact a lending partner\n              that have been approved by Egoras token holders to validate the\n              individual and post the loans on Egoras protocol. The lending\n              partner validates the user’s information. The kind of collaterals\n              and its features to be used for the loan are also uploaded by the\n              validating lending partner.\n            </div>\n            {/* ==================== */}\n            {/* ==================== */}\n            {/* ==================== */}\n            <div className=\"section whitepaper-layer5\" id=\"white_layer_5\">\n              <h1 className=\"layer-header\">Collateral Approval Governance</h1>\n              It is to be noted that the current microfinance sector managed by\n              NGOs and microfinance bank approve loans for borrowers after\n              proper due diligence have been carried out, but the Egoras\n              protocol uses a crowdsourced knowledge to approve or decline\n              collaterals backing the loans. The people vote if the collaterals\n              should be approved or declined, and the people also share in the\n              risk of the loans.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              Egoras holders approve this loan within after a certain threshold\n              is reached.

Egoras microfinance\n              protocol addresses this challenge by providing loans at zero\n              interest with collaterals required to get the loans. The\n              collaterals are represented as Non - Fungible Tokens (NFTs). NFT\n              is a unique and non-interchangeable unit of data stored on a\n              digital ledger (blockchain) and can be used to represent\n              reproducible items. NFTS can be used to establish a verified and\n              public proof of ownership. The implication for Egoras Protocol is\n              that collateral ownership can be transferred easily without\n              undergoing rigorous legal works. Collaterals can be claimed after\n              the loan period. Every transaction is public and immutable as all\n              transactions are recorded as NFTs on a public Blockchain.\n            </div>\n            {/* ==================== */}\n            {/* ==================== */}\n            {/* ==================== */}\n            <div className=\"section whitepaper-layer6\" id=\"white_layer_7\">\n              <h1 className=\"layer-header\">NFT Farming</h1>\n              In simple terms, NFT farming is concerned with staking NFTs for a\n              reward or staking tokens for an NFT as a reward. It combines NFT\n              technology and decentralized finance (Defi). Ultimately NFT\n              farming creates liquidity and utility for NFTs that would\n              otherwise hardly do anything.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              Egoras NFT farming furthers the concept of token staking and\n              liquidity farming, with users staking native tokens to earn an\n              additional yield through an NFT-based reward. Unlike traditional\n              staking, which pays out the reward in the natively staked token,\n              users, through Egoras NFT farming, can obtain NFTs assets\n              redeemable for offline goods.

EGR is a governance token. There exists a maximum of\n              100M EGR.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              As a governance token, EGR is used by EGR holders to vote for the\n              risk management and business logic of the Egoras Protocol. Risk\n              management is crucial for the success and survival of the system\n              and is done in practice by voting on specific risk parameters for\n              each loan and lending partner. The risk parameters need to be set\n              rigorously to correspond to the risk profile of the loans and the\n              lending partner in the system.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              The voting process for the governance of the system is done\n              through continuous approval voting. This means every EGR holder\n              can vote for any number of proposals with the EGR he holds and can\n              submit a new proposal or withdraw his votes at any point in time.\n              The proposal that has the most votes from all EGR holders becomes\n              the “top proposal” and can be activated to implement changes to\n              the risk parameters of the system.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              There is a simple app available that allows any EGR holder to\n              easily vote with their EGR by using metamask, ledger and\n              fortmatic. More advanced features are planned for the future, such\n              as delegating your votes to a proxy voter, and the ability to\n              safely vote with EGR held in cold storage. If EGR holders are\n              highly competent and govern the protocol well, The Egoras credit\n              system will get adopted and will always remain overcollateralized.\n            </div>\n\n            {/* ========================= */}\n            {/* ========================= */}\n            {/* ========================= */}\n            {/* ========================= */}\n            <div className=\"section whitepaper-layer6\" id=\"white_layer_16\">\n              <h1 className=\"layer-header\">The Egoras Credit (EGC)</h1>\n              As a utility token, EGC is required for paying the inventory fees\n              accrued on Loans that have been used to generate EUSD in the\n              Egoras Protocol. Only EGC can pay these fees, and when paid the\n              EGC is burned, removing it from the supply. This means that if the\n              adoption and demand for EUSD and Egoras Credit system increases,\n              there will be additional demand for EGC so users can pay the fees.\n              It also means the supply will decrease as EGC is burned.\n            </div>\n            {/* ========================= */}\n            {/* ========================= */}\n            {/* ========================= */}\n            {/* ========================= */}\n            <div className=\"section whitepaper-layer6\" id=\"white_layer_17\">\n              <h1 className=\"layer-header\">\n                How EGC Facilitates the stability of EgorasUSD\n              </h1>\n              If demand goes down for the EUSD, prices will fall on secondary\n              markets. What happens then? Suppose the redemption price of EUSD\n              is $1.00. If the price of EUSD on the open market is $0.98,\n              arbitrageurs will be incentivized to buy it up and redeem it with\n              the Egoras smart contract for $1.00 worth of EGC or eNFTs. They\n              will continue buying in the open markets until there is no more\n              money to be made, which is when the market price matches the\n              redemption price of $1.00. The same mechanism works in reverse\n              when demand goes up. If the price of EUSD in the open market is\n              $1.02, arbitrageurs will be incentivized to purchase newly minted\n              EUSD tokens for $1.00 worth of either collateral or Egoras Credit\n              tokens (the latter only if there is an excess pool of EUSD tokens\n              available), and immediately sell them in the open market. They’ll\n              continue selling in the open markets until there is no more money\n              to be made, which is when the market price matches the purchase\n              price of $1.00.\n            </div>\n            {/* ==================== */}\n            {/* ==================== */}\n            {/* ==================== */}\n            <div className=\"section whitepaper-layer6\" id=\"white_layer_18\">\n              <h1 className=\"layer-header\"> Conclusion</h1>\n              <div className=\"sub-texts-para last\">\n                Egoras microfinance protocol addresses the challenges facing the\n                microfinance industry like high interest rates, over-dependency\n                on banks and over-indebtedness.\n              </div>\n              <div className=\"sub-texts-para last\">\n                Egoras protocol allows microfinance organizations to get loans\n                at zero interest rate in EUSD, converting the collaterals of\n                small business owners into digital assets and represented on\n                blockchain as NFTs.\n              </div>\n              <div className=\"sub-texts-para last\">\n                EUSD is a decentralized stable coin that is not issued or\n                administered by any centralized actor or trusted intermediary or\n                counterparty.
